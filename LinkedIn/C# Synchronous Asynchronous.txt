Synchronous
- It works in single thread
- Doesn’t help in responsive UI
- Best for quick and simple tasks
- It blocks the main thread and UI
- Cancellation token not supported
- It throws the exception immediately but async keeps them in Task

Asynchronous
- Support cancellation tokens
- To use it we need async/await keyword
- It is UI friendly and can be multi-threaded
- Use them for handling multiple requests concurrently
- Putting await in our code doesn’t block the main thread
- Use asynchronous programming for lengthy I/O operations
- By using the await we can wait until the results are computed
